"The stand pickup service will be a business-to-business operation, providing transportation services on a rental basis. This system will involve unlocking and locking bicycles, motorcycles, and other vehicles. Customers can make online payments to access vehicles from designated stations. Once the payment is processed, the corresponding vehicle will unlock based on the payment amount. This service operates on an hourly basis, charging customers for each hour of use.!"

1- Vehicles Stations 
2- Lock and Unlock Vehicles
3- Online and offline Money payments system
4- putting a price on time
